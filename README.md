## Overview

#### The objective is to create Web App that helps users to store their spotify playlists from the Spotify api and users can tehn locally save the playlist that they like.

#### The web app should store user's playlist and show the previously saved list even after a page refresh.

<!-- ### **_My experience_**

I used React hooks like **_useState, useEffect_** and **_REDUX_**. Redux was used to store data globally so that data can be accessed by all components or data sent to global storage(redux state) without to worry about prop drilling.

For styling I used **_Tailwind_** framework and for Icons **_MaterialUI_**.

<!-- I built this in 3 days -->

<!-- ### **_What have I learned/improved_**

I learnt about **_REDUX_**, spotify Api. I have little improved in React, and after using 2nd time in project now I am comfortable with Tailwind. --> -->

## **Built with**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)

## **Features**

### Screen is divied into two 2 panes:

### **Left pane**: Display list of featured playlists from the Spotify Web API

### **Right pane**: Display list of locally saved user's playlists

### The user should be able to create his local playlist by dragging playlists from the left pane to the right pane.
